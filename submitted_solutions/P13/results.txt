With 2 threads:

With 4 threads:
8.513


With 8 threads:
5.994


With 16 threads:
5.467


With 32 threads:

With 64 threads:

QUESTION: After threading is added to threads.cpp, is the order of prime numbers found in primes_threads.txt the same or different than in primes.txt?  Why?

Different - different threads finish at different times, AND the order in which they would solve changes with the number of threads


QUESTION: Does adding more threads continue to speed up the program? Do more threads ever slow down the program slightly?  Why or why not?

It seems that adding more continued to speed up the program, just because equal processing power applied to more threads reducing total runtime.


QUESTION: Does adding more threads increase the "system load", or is it constant regardless of the number of threads?  Why?

System load increases because while the task is completed more efficiently, the system is managing a greater number of threads.
